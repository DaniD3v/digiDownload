# Async
This library makes extensive use of asyncio, allowing your code to be more efficient.

# Future plans
Add synchronous Book/Session class wrappers to make this more accessible for beginners.
Allow for downloading all the volumes of an E-Book instead of simply using the first one.

# Compatibility
Due to the inconsistency of digi4school this library only supports a limited set of books.
Because I can only test the library with the books I have access to, I don't even know which books will work.

- Books hosted directly on digi4school.at or hpthek.at will likely work
- there is limited compatibility with books that have multiple volumes

# Known Issues
Black background in images making use of transparency. This is due to svglib and I can't do anything about it, because there aren't any alternatives. cairosvg doesn't handle images at all and is to slow.
